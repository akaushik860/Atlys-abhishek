# Atlys Assignment


## Overview

This is a frontend project designed to demonstrate basic functionality for a blog platform, including user authentication (login/signup) and creating new posts. The project is built using modern frontend technologies.

## Features

### User Authentication: Login and signup forms are available. Currently, there is no proper logic implemented for these features as there is no backend API. This can be managed using state management and storing data in local storage or cookies.


### New Post Creation: Users can access the interface to create new posts. The logic for adding new posts is not working due to incomplete UI assignment but can be implemented using state management.

## Installation

### `npm install`

This will install all necessary modules.

### `npm start`

start the server on localhost:3000

## Future Improvements

### State Management: Implement proper state management using Redux or Context API to handle authentication and post creation.

### Local Storage/Cookies: Store user data in local storage or cookies to simulate backend authentication.

### API Integration: Integrate with a backend API to handle authentication and post creation in a real-world scenario.
